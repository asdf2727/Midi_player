# Midi_player
A console program to play and create midi files

This was my first attempt at working with the .midi file format, and I used it to create an autoplayer for virtual pianos controled via keyboard, such as [this](https://recursivearts.com/virtual-piano/). The project ended up to be a mess, but more importantly, a functional mess. It is able to take as input live midi channels and .midi files, and it outputs them via an emulated keyboard.
